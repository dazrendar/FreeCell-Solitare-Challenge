# FreeCell-Solitare-Challenge

How-To: Game resolution should be set to 16:9

Open "SampleScene" in Scenes folder.

Game should be functioning properly now.

Simple Json I/O support for high score.

Challenges: had to do a lot of refactoring from my previous approach. Could also stand to simplify a few things, reorganize fields, rename some variables; might continue to work on it for leisure.
