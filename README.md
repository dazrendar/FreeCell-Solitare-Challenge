# FreeCell-Solitare-Challenge

This build is the main game screen, without any splash pages. It deals the deck randomly and allows the user to click the card on to put it into the free cell spaces, or click and drag around the screen. 

I am not particularly stuck on any one feature; just ran out of time. As for the JSON i/o, I suppose it could be useful for exporting and importing user statistics (e.g., "current global top score"). But, it is not (yet!) in my implementation.

Thanks!
